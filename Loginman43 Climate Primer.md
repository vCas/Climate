# About the Auther ( /u/Logiman43 )
10 years ago I was the guy chained up to a tree, 5 years ago I was the guy blocking the street trying to get your attention to stop eating meat. I was arrested, ridiculed and "roughed up". Now I’m just tired. I’m a Ph.D. in int.relations with a specialization in climate conflicts(and 2 other - a master in Law and a master in Finance).

Please see [here]( https://www.futuretimeline.net/forum/topic/17231-climate-change-scientific-paper-library/) for 30,000 scientific papers about this fu*ked up situation. But showing research to people doesn’t work so

#Let’s get to it.

Here you have a 30 minutes talk about why everything must collapse. ["There's no infinite growth"]( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qPb_0JZ6-Rc).

5 years ago there was a tv show called The Newsroom. It was mostly a serious tv show with some comedic tones about the world of media. There is a [famous 5 minutes clip](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uc1vrO6iL0U) about climate collapse.

#Global Warming:

The below is based on this collection of [sources](https://docs.google.com/document/d/13hjFQnyRHfQiSZ2fHD4jjvudaPOR99WwZHwdImylD_4/edit) and the doc [here]( https://threadreaderapp.com/thread/1162767410862202880.html)

[According to a 2018 report]( https://www.climatecentral.org/gallery/graphics/the-globe-is-already-above-1c) the have the current global temperature is above 1C the pre-industrial mean. What will happen with every 0.5? [The climate action tracker shows we will reach a 3.5C with the current policies by 2050]( https://pbs.twimg.com/media/ECL96ggWkAA-5Z6.jpg).

*1.5C* - This used to be the point at which scientists thought we were OK. In 2018 the IPCC wanted to stop global warming at this temperature predicting we will hit it with a 10% chance by 2023. At this temperature, heatwaves across the globe will happen every single year, and these 'new' heatwaves will be as hot as the Sahara Desert. There will be massive crop destruction, 70% of coral in the ocean will be bleached, and drought will affect 360M people. [source]( https://i.imgur.com/BO0dlLh.png ). *Guess what* [according to the month-old IPCC 2019 report we are almost at 1.5C already]( https://www.ipcc.ch/site/assets/uploads/2019/08/SPM1-approval-FINAL.pdf). The number of loss events (Tsunamis, storms, flood, wildfire) between 1980-2015 has [QUADRUPLED]( https://lokisrevengeblog.files.wordpress.com/2017/07/22.jpg).

Historically, every climate [summit]( https://i.imgur.com/23GA1Pm.jpg) missed their target of limiting GHG emissions by a lot.  [Another angle]( https://i.imgur.com/cMpuRwJ.png). Since the adoption of the Paris climate accord at the end of 2015, 33 global banks have provided [$1.9 trillion to fossil fuel companies](https://www.ran.org/press-releases/bankingonclimatechange_2019/). The amount of financing has risen in each of the past two years.

## Biomass and 6th extinction

Earth appears to be undergoing a process of "biological annihilation."Humanity Has Killed 83% of All Wild Mammals and Half of All Plants, Of all the birds left in the world, 70% are poultry chickens and other farmed birds[Source](https://www.globalcitizen.org/en/content/humans-destroyed-83-of-wildlife-report/). A 2017 study looked at animal populations across the planet by examining 27,600 vertebrate species — about half of the overall total that we know exist. They found that more than 30% of them are in decline. Some species are facing total collapse, while local populations of others are going extinct in specific areas. Moreover humans wiped out 60% of animal populations since 1970 [Source]( https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2018/oct/30/humanity-wiped-out-animals-since-1970-major-report-finds)

Insects are dying off at record rates. Roughly 40% of the world's insect species are in decline, according to one study. Insects aren't the only creatures taking a hit. In the past 50 years, more than 500 amphibian species have declined worldwide — and 90 have gone extinct — due to a deadly fungal disease that corrodes frog flesh. [Source](https://www.businessinsider.com/signs-of-6th-mass-extinction-2019-3?IR=T)

And Plants are going extinct up to 350 times faster than the [historical norm]( https://qz.com/africa/1694276/plants-are-going-extinct-350-times-faster-than-normal/)

On the other hand, [Look at the explosion](https://i.imgur.com/dXdidBf.jpg) of domesticated animals between 1950 and 2000. Cattle is one of the causes of  global warming. Ie. The Amazon is being cut down not for lumber but to make room for cattle [Source]( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O6DFvW2c4rk) Our hope in her is all the Beyondmeat, Impossible burger which are not using animal protein and are way better for the environment.

Re: fishes. There are entire “dark fleets” that turn off their transponders, allowing them to hide illicit activity such as [illegal fishing](https://www.wired.co.uk/article/illegal-fishing-global-fishing-watch). With one in five fish now caught illegally, and with 93 per cent of commercial stocks now fully- or over-exploited, the drive to end pirate fishing has never been greater. Or The Gulf of Alaska [ Gulf of Alaska fishery to close for the first time ever: No more cod: Salmon all but gone: Millions of small sea birds died since 2015](https://www.thebigwobble.org/2019/12/fish-all-gone-gulf-of-alaska-fishery-to.html)

And have you heard about bottom-trawling A quarter of the world’s seafood caught in the ocean is collected through this method. New analysis, which brings together the contributions of 57 scientists across 22 countries, suggests that 14 per cent of the seafloor, shallower than 1,000m, is [trawled](https://www.independent.co.uk/environment/university-of-washington-bottom-trawling-seafloor-report-ecosystems-a8574381.html).

[The bleaching of the Barrier reefs](https://youtu.be/Rmkyj9qghGY) or the [“dead zones”](https://www.plymouth.ac.uk/news/could-dark-carbon-be-concealing-the-true-scale-of-ocean-dead-zones) are also caused by Global warming.‘Dead zones’ within the world’s oceans – where there is almost no oxygen to sustain life – could be expanding far quicker than currently thought, a new study suggests. The regions are created when large amounts of organic material produced by algae sinks towards the seafloor, using up the oxygen present in the deep water.

## Population

[The steep curve of population]( https://i.imgur.com/5fEjb2t.png). If our numbers grow by 228,000 on an average day, then in one week, we will have added about 1,589,000 extra persons to world population. And five days after that we will add another million and then another and another, and we are on track to continue this way repeatedly into the foreseeable future. Never before in human history have we asked our governments, infrastructure, social institutions, earth's environment, and the social fabric of our civilizations to respond to and accommodate such mammoth increase numbers in such compressed periods of time. [Source]( https://www.populationinstitute.org/programs/gpso/gpso/). To prepare for it Humanity must produce more food in the next four decades than we have in the last 8,000 [years]( https://richardvanhooijdonk.com/blog/en/humanity-must-produce-more-food-in-the-next-four-decades-than-we-have-in-the-last-8000-years-the-dutch-may-have-the-solutions/) But we are wasting so much food and losing so much water in irrigation that taking all this into account Society will collapse by 2040 due to catastrophic food shortages. The results show that based on plausible climate trends, and a total failure to change course, the global food supply system would face catastrophic losses, and an unprecedented epidemic of food riots.

##Migrations

[Tens, hundreds of millions of climate refugees. MIT source]( https://www.technologyreview.com/s/613342/get-ready-for-tens-of-millions-of-climate-refugees/). By 2050 there will be 1.5B migrants. Yes, it’s in [30 years]( https://www.vice.com/en_us/article/59n9qa/climate-change-will-create-15-billion-migrants-by-2050-and-we-have-no-idea-where-theyll-go?). And it will increase the [potential for conflicts and violence]( https://www.news.iastate.edu/news/2019/02/13/climateconflict). A study by the Pentagon confirms [there will wars caused by migrants]( https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2019-01-23/pentagon-fears-confirmed-climate-change-leads-to-war-refugees).

There will be a rise of fascism and concentration camps. Trump already tried this with the camps south and China is doing terrible things to Uighurs [my comment about the crimes against the Uighurs](https://www.reddit.com/r/worldnews/comments/ee5b95/hong_kong_protesters_rally_against_chinas_uighur/fbrdr4g/). We will see a rise of this over the next 30 years.

##Famines

We can already see the effects of extreme weather on food shortages. [45M Southern African are facing starvation](https://beta.theglobeandmail.com/world/article-extreme-weather-leaves-45-million-in-southern-africa-facing-severe/). Climate change looks [like starvation](https://www.thenation.com/article/climate-change-media-humanitarian-crises/)

Jet stream patterns could also destroy multiple [crops](https://phys.org/news/2019-12-large-atmospheric-jet-stream-global.html). Climate variability is responsible for at least 30% of the annual fluctuations in worldwide agricultural yield. Under "normal" climatic conditions, the global food system can compensate for local crop losses through grain storage and trade. However, it is doubtful whether the current system is resilient to more extreme climatic conditions. Climatic shocks to agricultural production contribute to food price spikes and famine, with the potential to trigger other systemic risks, including political unrest and migration.

## Scarcity of freshwater

 [India has 5 years to solve the water crisis]( https://edition.cnn.com/2019/06/27/india/india-water-crisis-intl-hnk/index.html), South Africa has the worst drought in 1000 [years]( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zAvaH_txwGM), Zambia has 2M of brink of starvation thanks to regional [drought]( https://www.news24.com/Africa/News/2-million-on-brink-of-starvation-in-regional-drought-in-zambia-20191030).

According to the [UN report]( https://www.un.org/waterforlifedecade/scarcity.shtml) in 10 years, 4 billion people will be short of fresh water, 2 billion will be severely short of it.

## Illnesses

As the rest of the Earth warms, animals will be forced to migrate en masse. This means animals carrying tropical diseases (such as malaria. To give you an idea of why this should really scare you is because diseases like camel flu have a mortality rate of 36%. And the world’s hospitals [are not ready for the health challenges of climate change]( https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/u-s-is-unprepared-for-the-health-challenges-of-climate-change-experts-warn/)

Report from the WHO [World at risk](https://apps.who.int/gpmb/assets/annual_report/GPMB_annualreport_2019.pdf). They listed dozens of illnesses that the experts suggested had the potential to trigger an outbreak which could spiral out of control, among them the plague, Ebola, Zika virus and Dengue. A flu-like deadly pandemic could sweep the world in hours and kill millions because NO country is fully prepared. A century ago the Spanish flu pandemic infected a third of the world's population and killed 50million people.

* Lyme disease: A recent CDC report found that the number of cases of illnesses transmitted by ticks more than doubled between 2004 and 2016 in the US; the greatest jump was seen in cases of Lyme disease. Researchers identified warming temperatures and shorter winters as one of the reasons. Also, the change in weather allowed ticks to invade areas that had previously been too cold for them to live.
* West Nile virus: Temperatures soared this past summer in Europe. At the same time, there was a sharp spike in West Nile virus infection – with more than 400 cases reported. Health experts believe the two are connected. The disease is spread by mosquitoes that have fed on infected birds, and warmer temperatures have helped to start the transmission season early.
* Malaria: In Ethiopia and Colombia, scientists observed that malaria’s range shifted to warmer areas between 1990 to 2005. In part because the transmitting mosquito thrives in the heat. But also, because the parasite that causes malaria reproduces faster inside the vector mosquito when the weather is warmer.
* Flesh-Eating Bacteria: It’s not just humans who enjoy a nice swim in the ocean when the weather is hot. Flesh-eating bacteria called vibriosis flourish in warm seawater. As temperatures climb and sea levels rise, they increase in number and can infect people through open wounds or by contaminating popular seafood like oysters.

##Pollution

The scale of Pollution is terrifying and only growing.

Oil spills from tankers are getting rarer  [chart](https://ourworldindata.org/uploads/2013/03/Number-of-oil-spills-750x525.png) but just because US and Canada are expanding the local oil drilling production. Look at this timelapse of 10,000 oil spills in the Gulf of MExico between [2010-2015](https://skytruth.org/2015/04/the-other-gulf-oil-disaster/). It’s like the Gulf getting Chlamydia. The US is now the largest global crude [oil producer](https://www.eia.gov/todayinenergy/detail.php?id=37053) and it’s permian region (texas) went from 1,000 barrels a day in 2010 to almost 5,000 b/d in [2019](https://www.eia.gov/petroleum/drilling/pdf/permian.pdf) and production could double [by 2023](https://www.dallasnews.com/business/energy/2018/06/13/permian-basin-could-double-oil-production-by-2023-trailing-only-saudi-arabia-russia/). 47% of U.S. oil fields that are discovered — but not yet developed — are dependent on fossil fuel subsidies and Subsidy-dependency varies fairly widely by region. In the Williston Basin of North Dakota, for example, 59% of oil resources are subsidy dependent. In the Permian Basin of Texas, that number is 40%.

Shell is building a $6 billion ethane cracking plant — a facility that turns ethane into ethylene, a building block for many kinds of plastic — in Monaca, Pennsylvania, 25 miles northwest of Pittsburgh. It is expected to produce up 1.6 million tons of plastic annually after it opens in the early 2020s. And then everything ends in poor countries. [River of trash](https://theintercept.com/2019/10/27/plastic-pollution-guatemala/)

Landfills and the myth of recycling. Just watch [Plastic China](https://www.plasticchina.org/)The UK, like most developed nations, produces more waste than it can process at home: 230m tonnes a year – about 1.1kg per person per day. (The US, the world’s most wasteful nation, produces 2kg per person per day.) Before the China ban, US was exporting 20M tons of plastic to China. The present dumping ground of choice is Malaysia. In October last year, a Greenpeace Unearthed investigation found mountains of British and European waste in illegal dumps there: Tesco crisp packets, Flora tubs and recycling collection bags from three London councils. As in China, the waste is often burned or abandoned, eventually finding its way into rivers and oceans. [Source](https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2019/aug/17/plastic-recycling-myth-what-really-happens-your-rubbish) Only 8.7% of plastic is recycled [Yep](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zVBkjMbF4Z4).

Fashion is also to blame. In 2015, fashion create more emissions than all international flights and maritime [shipping combined](https://youtu.be/xGF3ObOBbac?t=706). Around 10% of global greenhouse gas emission are churned out by the fashion industry, due to its long supply chains and energy intensive production. Textile factories in China, where “over 50%” of the worlds clothing is now made” spew out around three billion tons of soot every year burning coal, contaminating the air leading to respiratory and heart disease. Textile mills are estimated to generate 20% of the world’s industrial water pollution and use 20,000 chemicals, many of them carcinogenic. While people bought 60% more garments in 2014 than in 2000, they only kept the clothes for half as long (throwing 80lbs of cloths a year per American). A lot of this clothing ends up in the dump. The equivalent of one garbage truck full of clothes is burned or dumped in a landfill every second. In total, up to 85% of textiles go into landfills each year. That’s enough to fill the Sydney harbor annually.

Washing clothes, meanwhile, releases 500,000 tons of microfibers into the ocean each year — the equivalent of 50 billion plastic bottles. Many of those fibers are polyester, a plastic found in an estimated 60% of garments. Producing polyester releases two to three times more carbon emissions than cotton, and polyester does not break down in the ocean. A 2017 report from the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) estimated that 35% of all microplastics — very small pieces of plastic that never biodegrade — in the ocean came from the laundering of synthetic textiles like polyester. plastic pollution ocean waste environment. Polyester, nylon, spandex use 342M barrels of oil EACH YEAR. 33% of viscose in clothes comes from forests and 70% of the harvested wood is dumped [ Source](https://www.businessinsider.fr/us/fast-fashion-environmental-impact-pollution-emissions-waste-water-2019-10).

## Permafrost and Methane. [Soil in the Arctic Is Now Releasing More Carbon Dioxide Than 189 Countries](https://www.globalcitizen.org/en/content/arctic-soil-releasing-carbon-dioxide/)

At 2C level we expect 6.6 million square kilometers of permafrost to thaw. And create a feedback loop of releasing a lot of methane which means that melting ice caps and permafrost becomes a self-accelerating extinction. [Already boiling with Methane]( https://www.iflscience.com/environment/seas-boiling-with-methane-on-scale-never-before-seen-reported-in-siberia/) But that is also terrifying because we know that there are pathogens [frozen in that permafrost](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tSA5HNFBwnk) - pathogens like [anthrax]( https://siberiantimes.com/other/others/news/n0694-20-people-now-infected-by-zombie-anthrax-outbreak-in-siberia-say-officials/).

## Topsoil erosion

 We are running out of topsoil [Source]( https://therising.co/2019/04/05/research-shows-we-are-running-out-of-topsoil/), by 2055 we will have none of it [video]( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y2bBimj0dFU). That's the warning of "Surviving the 21st Century" author Julian Cribb to an international soil science conference in Queenstown, New Zealand on Dec 15, 2016. "10 kilos of topsoil, 800 litres of water, 1.3 litres of diesel, 0.3g of pesticide and 3.5 kilos of carbon dioxide – that's what it takes to deliver one meal, for just one person," [Cribb says.]( https://phys.org/news/2016-12-meal-eaten-planet-kilos-lost.html#nRlv). And it takes 2000 years to form 5cm of topsoil. If you don't think this will affect you...just you wait until food becomes the rarest commodity on Earth. If you think you have seen human barbarity, just wait until those same humans are starving and desperate for food. This won't mean millions starving. It will mean billions starving. Including you.

## The Blue Ocean event

 A Blue Ocean Event means that huge amounts of sunlight won't get reflected back into space anymore, as they previously were. Instead, the heat will have to be absorbed by the Arctic. As long as the Arctic Ocean has sea ice, most sunlight gets reflected back into space and the 'Center-of-Coldness' remains near the North Pole. A Blue Ocean Event will not only mean that additional heat will have to be absorbed in the Arctic, but also that wind patterns will change radically and even more dramatically than they are already changing now, which will also make that other tipping points will be reached earlier. This is why a Blue Ocean Event is an important tipping point and it will likely be reached abruptly and disruptively by 2022.[source]( http://arctic-news.blogspot.com/2018/09/blue-ocean-event.html) The arctic ice [volume over the years]( https://haveland.com/share/arctic-death-spiral.jpg) in one chart. It is a Death spiral.

## The [ice sheet feedback loop](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QubYjSTMGs0)

 And when it comes to rising ocean levels it's becoming increasingly difficult to predict because not only are we heating the air, heat is getting trapped in the oceans too which means that ice sheets in the Arctic circle and Greenland are melting from above *and* below - meaning they're melting much MUCH faster than we estimated even in our most extreme estimates. This will mean that Florida and New York could be completely underwater. If you're worried about refugees from Central and Latin America or Africa, you'll want to start thinking about the tens of millions of people that will be fleeing inland to escape the inundations. [Rising Seas Will Erase even More Cities by 2050](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2019/10/29/climate/coastal-cities-underwater.html). It [triples our previous estimates](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-019-12808-z)

Warming oceans doesn't just mean rising ocean levels either - it means more ocean water gets evaporated, which means larger, faster and deadlier hurricanes and torrential disastrous downpours.

## [Wet bulb event]( https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2017/aug/02/climate-change-to-cause-humid-heatwaves-that-will-kill-even-healthy-people)  

The new analysis assesses the impact of climate change on the deadly combination of heat and humidity, measured as the “wet bulb” temperature (WBT). Once this reaches 35C, the human body cannot cool itself by sweating and even fit people sitting in the shade will die within six hours. Extreme heatwaves that kill even healthy people within hours will strike parts of the Indian subcontinent unless global carbon emissions are cut sharply and soon, according to new research. Even outside of these hotspots, three-quarters of the 1.7bn population – particularly those farming in the Ganges and Indus valleys – will be exposed to a level of humid heat classed as posing “extreme danger”.

Oceans are absorbing a large portion of the CO2 emitted into the atmosphere—in fact, oceans are the largest single carbon sink in the world, dwarfing the absorbing abilities of the Amazon rainforest. But the more CO2 the oceans absorb, the more acidic they become on a relative scale, because some of the carbon reacts within the water to form carbonic acid. If acidification decreases marine emissions of sulfur, it could cause an increase in the amount of solar energy reaching the Earth’s surface, speeding up warming—which is exactly what the Nature Climate Change study predicts. Researchers estimate that the pH of the ocean will drop by 0.4 pH units by the end of this century if carbon emissions are not stopped, or by 0.15 units if global temperature rise is limited to 2C.

#Conclusion

##The super-rich

The rich know that it is too late, and they will be the only one to survive the global warming [article]( https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/middle-east/climate-change-apartheid-poor-iraq-effects-heatwave-a9049206.html). They [are building bunkers and buying NZ passports to fly there when SHTF happens]( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wUJtxn1V7N4) and that’s why they are [getting richer and richer exponentially]( https://www.marketwatch.com/story/heres-how-share-buybacks-get-used-to-transfer-billions-of-dollars-to-senior-management-under-the-guise-of-returning-cash-to-shareholders-2019-10-30). For example Canada, Norway and Brasil will flood the world with oil just to profit at the maximum [Article from NYT from today "Flood of Oil Is Coming, Complicating Efforts to Fight Global Warming"](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/11/03/business/energy-environment/oil-supply.html). And if anything happens they will just buy Visas and [passports for 1M+ and bug out](https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2019/sep/27/number-of-foreigners-buying-uk-golden-visa-rises) while migrants are put into concentration camps.

##Politicians

I don’t want to talk much about politicians but there is a trend around the globe to have skeptics deny climate change from Australia [2019 - Whole Australia is burning](https://www.commondreams.org/news/2019/12/21/everything-burning-australian-inferno-continues-choking-access-cities-across-country) but its PM only tweets about brave [firefighters](https://i.redd.it/0fqtd0li4wz31.png) to [Trump’s specialists](https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2015/dec/08/greenpeace-exposes-sceptics-cast-doubt-climate-science) “Carbon dioxide is a actually a benefit to the world and so were the Jews”[Source](https://youtu.be/g6_gWPUiKAE?t=806). Bolsonaro is also a good example. [Bolsonaro’s response to fires in the Amazon rainforest --in recent months he denied they existed and then blamed them on the media ](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2019-12-12/from-trump-to-bolsonaro-climate-skeptics-stir-green-activism). Here’s a list of the main US [misinformers](https://skepticalscience.com/misinformers.php).

Canada sells itself as a leader on climate change but it has the 3rd largest world oil reserved. Canadians pipelines like the [Trans mountain pipeline](https://youtu.be/cDPeXoQUrbI)

And even Europe. [Polish cities rank amoung the Europe’s Dirtiest](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/04/22/world/europe/poland-pollution.html) or how Polish powerplant burns 1T of coal every [second](https://airqualitynews.com/2019/09/27/poland-power-plant-burns-one-tonne-of-coal-every-second/)

## Why going green is not the solution.

Costs of going green are insane and the global economy is unable to bear the brunt of this mass switch. Going 100% green energy is not possible with the current consumption. Earth lacks enough [metals]( https://lokisrevengeblog.files.wordpress.com/2017/11/heay-metal.jpg?w=696) to produce solar panels, batteries and ways to distribute energy around the globe.  Building one wind turbine requires 900 tons of steel, 2,500 tons of concrete and 45 tons of plastic.  Solar power requires even more cement, steel and glass—not to mention other metals. Global silver and indium mining will jump 250% and 1,200% respectively over the next couple of decades to provide the materials necessary to build the number of solar panels, the International Energy Agency forecasts. World demand for rare-earth elements—which aren’t rare but are rarely mined in America—will rise 300% to 1,000% by 2050 to meet the Paris green goals. If electric vehicles replace conventional cars, demand for cobalt and lithium, will rise more than 20-fold. That doesn’t count batteries to back up wind and solar grids. [Source]( https://www.wsj.com/articles/if-you-want-renewable-energy-get-ready-to-dig-11565045328) [A periodic table of elements that we are running out of]( https://www.fastcompany.com/3044467/a-periodic-table-of-elements-that-the-world-is-running-out-of) And China controls 90% of all rare minerals [source]( https://www.theguardian.com/sustainable-business/rare-earth-mining-china-social-environmental-costs)

A single electric-car battery weighs about 1,000 pounds. Fabricating one requires digging up, moving and processing more than 500,000 pounds of raw materials somewhere on the planet. The alternative? Use gasoline and extract one-tenth as much total tonnage to deliver the same number of vehicle-miles over the battery’s seven-year life.

John Sterman's (MIT's foremost system dynamics expert) shows even MAGIC tech can barely keep us below [4 degrees by 2100](https://youtu.be/gU9hPfx12GA?t=108)

[The new green deal is not enough](https://medium.com/@joshuafkon/the-world-is-not-going-to-meet-the-necessary-emission-reductions-even-a-green-new-deal-wont-12230cb9f3a7). The Developing World Is Increasing Emissions At Such A Rate That Any Emission Reduction By The Developed World Will Be Offset. Even if we imagined that the political will could be found in both the United States and the European Union to spend trillions on a Green New Deal, and we made the somewhat generous assumption that these plans would be successful in achieving net zero emissions by 2030, it would really have no meaningful impact on global carbon emissions thanks to China, Africa, India and South America.

Same with a meat tax. We can impose a tax on meat in the developed countries but China, India or South America are eating more and more meat by the day. [According to Asia Research and Engagement's report "charting Asia's protein journey", meat and seafood consumption in Asia will rise 33% by 2030 and 78% from 2017 to 2050](https://www.foodnavigator-asia.com/Article/2018/12/03/Expert-analysis-Meat-and-seafood-consumption-in-Asia-will-rise-78-by-2050)

The power grid is dying (at least in the US). The US military could collapse [within 20 years because of a fragile power gird](https://www.vice.com/en_us/article/mbmkz8/us-military-could-collapse-within-20-years-due-to-climate-change-report-commissioned-by-pentagon-says). Blackouts due to extreme weather (hurricanes, floods, wildfires) are on the rise, in part due to climate change, which is only going to get worse. Clean energy technologies threaten to overwhelm the grid - the issue [of top-down and DERs](https://www.vox.com/energy-and-environment/2018/11/30/17868620/renewable-energy-power-grid-architecture). And ¼ of all US bridges could collapse by [2040](https://www.newscientist.com/article/2221040-climate-change-may-see-one-in-four-us-steel-bridges-collapse-by-2040/). There were some 15,500 high-hazard dams in the US in 2016. For the full [report](https://www.infrastructurereportcard.org/)

##Why tree-loss prevention is more important than planting them.

[There’s too much CO2 in the atmosphere that planting trees can no longer save us]( https://www.businessinsider.com/so-much-co2-planting-trees-cant-save-us-2017-5?IR=T). However Scientists estimate that we need to plant 1 trillion trees to mitigate the GW. WITHOUT LOSING ONE SINGLE TREE because [a burning tree is releasing all the CO2 back](https://www.newscientist.com/article/2208610-unprecedented-arctic-megafires-are-releasing-a-huge-amount-of-co2/). The amazon is losing 3 football field’s PER MINUTE thanks to [fire]( https://www.businessinsider.com/amazon-losing-3-football-fields-worth-of-rainforest-per-minute-2019-8?IR=T). If you prefer an interactive [map](https://fires.globalforestwatch.org/map/). At the moment we are losing 13-15 million hectares per year in South America and Africa and south East Asia because it is converted from a forest to agriculture land. [Source]( http://www.fao.org/news/story/en/item/40893/icode/).

So, if we assume that 1M trees’ planted is one step that you make, then 20 meters is 20M trees right? 1 trillion trees are like 2.5x from where you're standing to the International Space station. Not to mention all the pollution by delivering the seeds (or small trees from tree farms), all the logistics in preparing the ground for planting and all the promotion waste etc.The #teamtree movement is a feel-good thing but by the end, [it is a marketing stunt](https://youtu.be/gqht2bIQXIY). Just look how the [views number exploded since Mr.Beast announced this movement. From 5M a day to 20M a day](https://i.imgur.com/Sw8QaHt.png). Additionally, GOOGL had an earning call on the 28th of October, 4 days after the teamtree was announced. Sure the movement had no impact on the earnings but some greenwashing won't hurt the marketing. And Mr. Beast is not really known to care for the environment. He often litter [thousands of ballons](https://youtu.be/vETSAZgfDP4). [Or he puts 100 Million Orbeez In his Friend's Backyard](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TflpIllQHY). Not to mention everything was imported from China on a [cargo ship](https://phys.org/news/2018-12-cargo-ships-emitting-boatloads-carbon.html). Or [How he drove 1000 times through the same drive tru with his massive Ford truck](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QxGVgXf_LNk). And [his world's largest cereal bowl? I bet some starving kids will feel good about his #teamtree now](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xRwy_rKc7gI). And [can you even recycle a pool of slim?](https://youtu.be/3ix_gbcubTo). So yes, he is greenwashing himself using your money.

### [Peak Copper]( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peak_copper)

An international team of researchers has looked at the material demands and pollution that would result from a push to get the globe to 40 percent renewables by the middle of the century. The analysis finds that despite the increased materials and energy demands, a push like this would result in a dramatic reduction in pollution. And for the most part, the material demands could be met, with the possible exception of copper.  40% Green Energy requires 200% more [copper]( https://www.climatecentral.org/news/renewable-energy-needs-huge-mineral-supply-16682) 100% green energy requires 500% more copper. We move some 3 billion tons of earth per year to get 15 millions tons of copper. We cannot recycle it into existence. Substituting aluminum for copper takes 5X the energy and is less safe. [And there is no substitutes for the metals]( https://www.vice.com/en_us/article/d73zvm/there-are-no-substitutes-for-the-metals-in-your-smartphone)

#Why nobody talks about collapse?

Because a world without hope is a burning world. Imagine 7B people realizing they don’t have 50-70 years of life but 20 or 30. [It’s pure chaos - Story of a redditor from Chile](https://www.reddit.com/r/StockMarket/comments/dktx0p/black_swan/). Additionally, the wealthy of this world are trying promoting such work ethics that you don't have the time to read, watch or study the above. This endless cycle of working-buying stuff-sleeping is damaging our society. We are becoming more and more ostracized from each other by using technology like FB or Tinder. Moreover, some countries or politicians are trying to destabilize the world as we know, to create confusion and conflicts between us. Divide and conquer. Why do you think Russia stands [behind Brexit](https://www.npr.org/2019/01/19/686830510/senate-finds-russian-bots-bucks-helped-push-brexit-vote-through), the [Black/Blue LM movement](https://slate.com/technology/2018/05/russian-trolls-are-obsessed-with-black-lives-matter.html?via=gdpr-consent) and the [rise of fascism in Europe](https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2018/08/russia-is-co-opting-angry-young-men/568741/)?
